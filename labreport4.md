## 3: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail 
Keys pressed: `cd<space>l<tab><enter>`, `bash<space>t<tab><enter>`
I typed out the `cd` command, and after typing the first letter `l` of the `lab7` directory, pressing `<tab>` autocompletes the directory path. I then pressed `<enter>` to run the command. Next, I typed out the `bash` command and typed out the first letter `t` of the `test.sh` file; pressing `tab` then autocompletes the file name, and then I ran the command by pressing `<enter>`.
